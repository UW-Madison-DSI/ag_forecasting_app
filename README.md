# **Forecasting Model Tools: API and Dashboard**

This API leverages the power of environmental data to predict the likelihood of diseases like Tarspot, Spore and Gray Leaf Spot on corn crops. 

## Features

- Predicts the probability of disease incidence based on key environmental variables.
- Customizable action thresholds that allow users to define risk levels for interventions.
- Returns the probability and risk classification for the given thresholds.

## Dashboard 
Visit our [dashboard here](https://connect.doit.wisc.edu/tarspot_forecasting_app/)

## API Endpoints

**Base URL**: [Forecast Crop Disease API](https://connect.doit.wisc.edu/forecasting_crop_disease/)

### Endpoints:

- `/predict_tarspot_risk`  
  Predicts the probability and risk level for **Tarspot**.

- `/predict_gray_leaf_spot_risk`  
  Predicts the probability and risk level for **Gray Leaf Spot**.

- `/predict_sporecaster_risk`  
  Predicts the probability and risk level for **Spore**.


Method: `POST` 

Response: A JSON object containing the predicted probability of tar spot incidence and the associated risk level.

## To install
